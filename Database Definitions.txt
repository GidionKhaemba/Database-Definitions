1.1.1. Database:
A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that a computer program can quickly select and retrieve desired pieces of data. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve information.

1.1.2. Table:
A table in a database is a structured representation of data consisting of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. Tables are used to organize and store data in a relational database.

1.1.3. Record:
A record, also known as a row, is a single entry or set of related data in a database table. It contains information about a specific entity or item and is composed of fields that represent different attributes of that entity.

1.1.4. Field:
A field is a single piece of data in a database record, corresponding to a specific attribute of the entity represented by the table. For example, in a table of employees, fields may include name, age, and job title.

1.1.5. Primary Key:
A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It must contain unique values, and no two records can have the same primary key. The primary key is used to establish relationships between tables.

1.1.6. SQL:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands for querying, updating, and managing databases, including creating and modifying tables.

1.1.7. Query:
A query is a request for information from a database. It is written in SQL and is used to retrieve specific data from one or more tables based on defined criteria.

1.1.8. Index:
An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It works similar to an index in a book, allowing the database management system to quickly locate and access the rows that match a certain value.

1.1.9. Normalization:
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them to improve data integrity and avoid data anomalies.

1.1.10. Database Management System (DBMS):
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface for interacting with a database. It facilitates the creation, maintenance, and usage of databases by users and applications, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data retrieval.

2. Section B: Discussions

2.1.1. Purpose of a Primary Key:
The purpose of a primary key in a database table is to uniquely identify each record in that table. It ensures that each row has a distinct identifier, which is crucial for establishing relationships between tables. For example, in a table of employees, an employee ID could serve as the primary key.

2.1.2. Difference between DBMS and Database:
A database is the actual organized collection of data, while a Database Management System (DBMS) is the software that manages, manipulates, and interacts with that data. The DBMS handles tasks such as data storage, retrieval, and security, providing an interface for users and applications to interact with the database.

2.1.3. Importance of Normalization:
Normalization is important in database design to eliminate data redundancy and dependency, reducing the risk of data anomalies. By breaking down tables and establishing relationships, normalization improves data integrity and ensures that updates, inserts, and deletes are accurately and efficiently performed. For example, in a database without normalization, updating a piece of information may require changing multiple records, leading to inconsistencies. Normalization addresses this issue by organizing data more efficiently.
